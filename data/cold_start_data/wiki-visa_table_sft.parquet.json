To answer this, I need to examine the provided images and look for relevant information about \"yang\" and its meaning within Chinese culture or philosophy. I will start by looking for definitions or explanations of \"yang\" directly, or within related contexts like Yin and Yang.\n\n1.  I will start by examining Image 3, as it contains a visual representation of the Taijitu (Yin and Yang symbol), which might provide some context. I see a section titled \"Structure\" that mentions \"yin and yang symbol\" (bbox_2d: (425, 102, 432, 212), Image_index: 3). It discusses the symbol's components and mentions that the symbol is often referred to as representing \"yin and yang\" (bbox_2d: (408, 668, 415, 716), Image_index: 3). This suggests a close relationship between the symbol and the concept of \"yang.\"\n2.  I will also look at Image 3, \"History\" section.

(bbox_2d: (135, 24, 177, 708), Image_index: 2).\n4.  From the table, I can see that \"Yang\" is associated with:\n    *   Season: Spring, Summer\n    *   Climate: Hot\n    *   Development: Sprouting, Blooming\n    *   Direction: South, East\n    *   Planet: Mars, Jupiter\n\n    These associations give a sense of \"Yang\" representing growth, heat, and outward energy.\n</think>\n<answer> Based on the \"Theory of the Five Elements\" table in Image 2, \"Yang\" in Chinese culture is associated with concepts like Spring and Summer, heat, sprouting and blooming, and the directions South and East. This suggests that Yang represents growth, warmth, activity, and outward energy. (bbox_2d: (135, 24, 177, 708), Image_index: 2).\n</answer>",

This section discusses past total solar eclipses.\n\nThe text states: \"The path of totality of the total solar eclipse of February 26, 1979 crossed only the states of Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, and North Dakota.  The total solar eclipse of August 21, 2017 was the last total solar eclipse to cross the entire contiguous United States since June 8, 1918.\"  This indicates that the August 21, 2017 eclipse was the last to cross the entire contiguous U.S.\n\nHowever, the question doesn't specify \"entire contiguous United States\".  If we consider any part of the U.S., the text mentions other eclipses, but it clearly highlights the August 21, 2017 eclipse as the last one to cross the entire country.\n</think>\n<answer> August 21, 2017 (bbox_2d: (726, 76, 741, 226), Image_index: 0) was the last total solar eclipse to cross the entire contiguous United States.  The text also mentions other total solar eclipses, but doesn't explicitly state they were the last in the U.S. if only a partial crossing is considered.\n</answer>",

To answer this, I need to examine the document, particularly sections discussing recent elections or the current government structure. I will look for keywords like \"current government,\" \"premier,\" \"ruling party,\" or recent election results.\n1.  Scan the document for information about the current government. I see a section discussing the period \"1987 to present\". (bbox_2d: (590, 29, 600, 171), Image_index: 1).\n2.  Within that section, look for the most recent election results. I see a table showing election results up to 2014. (bbox_2d: (673, 260, 755, 706), Image_index: 1).\n3.  The 2014 election shows the Liberal party with 27 seats and the PC party with 21. This indicates the Liberal party won the 2014 election. (bbox_2d: (684, 544, 706, 706), Image_index: 1).\n4.  The text also mentions Brian Gallant was elected in 2014 with 27 seats.

Further down, there is no mention of any election results after 2014.\n\nTherefore, based on the information in the document, the Liberal party was in power after winning the 2014 election.\n</think>\n<answer> The Liberal party was in power after winning the 2014 election.
