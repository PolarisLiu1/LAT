To find the answer, I need to skim through the provided documents, focusing on sections discussing the history of Turner Field or the Atlanta Braves, and look for information about their previous stadium.\n\n1.  **Scan Document 1 (Turner Field):** I'll start by looking at the \"History\" section of the Turner Field document. It mentions that Turner Field was a converted stadium originally built for the 1996 Summer Olympics. It also says the Braves played at Atlanta–Fulton County Stadium before moving to Turner Field. (bbox_2d: (175, 21, 183, 623), Image_index: 1).\n\n2.  **Confirm with Document 3 (Atlanta Braves):** I will also check the \"Atlanta Braves\" document. The lead section says that their home stadium has been SunTrust Park (now Truist Park) since 2017, and before that, their home stadium was Turner Field. (bbox_2d: (71, 21, 86, 535), Image_index: 3). This doesn't directly answer the question, but it confirms Turner Field was a previous home.\n\n3.  **Further check in Document 1:** The History section of document 1 provides the precise answer. \"The Braves played the final game at Turner Field on October 2, 2016, a 1–0 win over the Detroit Tigers. The stadium was then reconfigured for the second time, redesigned for college football as Georgia State Stadium.\" and \"The ballpark was built in the Southeastern Atlanta neighborhood of Summerhill.[6] across the street from the former home of the Braves, Atlanta–Fulton County Stadium, which was demolished in the summer of 1997 and replaced with a parking lot. The parking lot is painted with the field location and configuration of the former ballpark.\" (bbox_2d: (175, 21, 208, 623), Image_index: 1).\n</think>\n<answer> The Atlanta Braves played at Atlanta–Fulton County Stadium before playing at Turner Field.

I'll be looking for keywords like \"throttle control\", \"electronic control\", and \"drive-by-wire\".\n\nScanning Document Image 1, I find the term \"electronics\" but nothing that specifically matches \"drive-by-wire\".\n\nScanning Document Image 2, I find information about \"oil burners\" and related control systems, but nothing about \"drive-by-wire electronic throttle control\".\n\nScanning Document Image 3, I find the term \"Traction control system\". I see mentions of \"electronic stability control (ESC)\" and discussions about controlling wheel spin and engine power. This seems relevant, so I'll examine this document more closely.\n\nIn Document Image 3, I can search for \"throttle\". I find a sentence: \"In turbocharged vehicles, a boost control solenoid is actuated to reduce boost and therefore engine power; however, most systems cut fuel delivery and/or ignition spark, and/or close the throttle if it is an electronic throttle control master cylinder type system, and wheel speed sensors with ABS.\" This mentions \"electronic throttle control\" in the context of reducing engine power, which aligns with the concept of \"drive-by-wire\".\n\nFurther reading reveals that traction control systems can intervene by:\n- Reduction or suppression of spark sequence to one or more cylinders\n- Reduction of fuel supply to one or more cylinders\n- Closing the throttle, if the vehicle is fitted with drive-by-wire throttle\n- In turbocharged vehicles, a boost control solenoid is actuated to reduce boost and therefore engine power.\n\nThe phrase \"drive-by-wire throttle\" appears in the list of interventions. This reinforces the connection between \"drive-by-wire\" and electronic throttle control.\n</think>\n<answer> Drive-by-wire electronic throttle control is a technology used in vehicles where the throttle is closed electronically as a method of intervention by the traction control system.

I will start by looking for \"Cambridge\" and \"quantity theory of money\".\n\n1.  I locate the term \"Cambridge equation\" in Image 1. This seems relevant as it's mentioned in the context of the \"Cambridge cash-balance theory,\" which is described as an alternative approach to the classical quantity theory of money. (bbox_2d: (49, 23, 56, 961), Image_index: 1).\n2.  The text explains that the Cambridge equation focuses on *money demand* instead of *money supply*. (bbox_2d: (63, 23, 70, 961), Image_index: 1).\n3.  It also highlights the difference in explaining the movement of money: velocity of money in the classical version versus the proportion of assets held as cash in the Cambridge approach. (bbox_2d: (70, 23, 84, 961), Image_index: 1).\n4.  The Cambridge equation is: M<sup>d</sup> = k.P.Y. (bbox_2d: (140, 23, 154, 960), Image_index: 1) Where:\n    *   M<sup>d</sup> is the demand for money.\n    *   P is the price level.\n    *   Y is real income.\n    *   k is the proportion of nominal income (PY) that people want to hold as cash.\n5.  The text explains that the Cambridge economists, including Alfred Marshall, A.C. Pigou, and John Maynard Keynes, argued that a portion of the money supply will be held for convenience and security. (bbox_2d: (98, 23, 113, 961), Image_index: 1). This portion is represented by 'k'.\n6.  The Cambridge equation, therefore, expresses the idea that the demand for money is proportional to nominal income, with 'k' representing the proportion of income held as cash.\n</think>\n<answer> The Cambridge version of the quantity theory of money, represented by the Cambridge equation (M<sup>d</sup> = k.P.Y), focuses on money demand rather than money supply. It posits that the demand for money (M<sup>d</sup>) is proportional to nominal income (P.Y), where 'k' represents the portion of nominal income that individuals and businesses choose to hold as cash for convenience and security. This contrasts with the classical quantity theory, which emphasizes the velocity of money.

It also mentions winning the 2017-18 Premier League title and regaining the title on the last day of the season, which, based on the context, refers to a different season than the previously mentioned ones. So there are at least 3 + 1 wins. The phrase \"regained the Premier League title\" implies a previous win. However, the specific number of wins is not explicitly stated in a single sentence. I'll need to carefully analyze the context around each mention of \"Premier League\" to determine the exact number.\n\nAfter careful reading, I can find the following instances of Manchester City winning the Premier League:\n*   2012 (bbox_2d: (169, 544, 180, 577), Image_index: 1)\n*   2014 (bbox_2d: (169, 583, 180, 612), Image_index: 1)\n*   2018 (bbox_2d: (169, 23, 180, 612), Image_index: 1)\n*   2017-18 (bbox_2d: (976, 23, 987, 500), Image_index: 1)\n* In the last paragraph of history section, it says they won the premier league title again, which refers to the 2013-2014 season.\n</think>\n<answer> Manchester City has won the Premier League multiple times, explicitly mentioned are 2011-12, 2013-14, and 2017-18 seasons. So at least 3 times are stated in the text. (bbox_2d: (169, 23, 180, 612), Image_index: 1), (bbox_2d: (976, 23, 987, 500), Image_index: 1).\n</answer>",

Due to this Gandhiji became disturbed and very sad and called off the movement as he always believed in non-violence. However, it is also true that the immediate reason for the disposal of the committee was the much criticised embezzlement of 1.6 million rupees.[citation needed] The Ali brothers were severely criticised by Muslim politicians and the public. Although holding talks with the British and continuing their activities, the Khilafat struggle weakened as Muslims were divided between working for the Congress, the Khilafat cause and the Muslim League.[9] After Hindu-Muslim riots of 1926–1927 many Muslim leaders like Mohammad Akram Khan lost interest in the movement.",
