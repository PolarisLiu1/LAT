The CL was established in 2005 to provide a standard reference nomenclature for in vivo cell types, initially those identified in specific tissues from experiments in humans and different model organisms. The semantic hierarchy of CL is mainly constructed using two core relations: is_a and derives_from. Mao et al. proposed a major revision to the CL, using dendritic cells as the driving biological use case in which the expression of specific marker proteins on the cell surface (e.g., receptor proteins) or internally (e.g., transcription factors) would be used as the main difference for the asserted hierarchy. Cohan et al. applied this approach, first to cell types of the hematopoietic system and then later to the full CL. (bbox_2d: (695, 102, 791, 488), Image_index: 1)\n</answer>",

Analyzing the last paragraph of the left column (Image 1): This paragraph mentions an \"ALIX/CHMP4B interface.\" It states that \"the inhibition of infectious EIAV particle release caused by co-depletion of CHMP4A and CHMP4B could be fully rescued by re-expression of wild type CHMP4B from an siRNA construct (compare lane 3 to lanes 1 and 2), but not by a mutant CHMP4B protein that could not bind ALIX (CHMP4B I.L217A, W.220A; compare lane 3 to lanes 4, 5, and see ref.

Scan Document Image 3 for relevant information. I find the terms \"MCI\" and \"PD\" in the introduction and methods sections. The term \"WM\" is also mentioned, which could stand for \"white matter\". Let's examine this section more closely. The introduction section says: \"Recently, the term “connectome” was proposed by modeling the human brain as a complex network, and graph theoretical approaches provide powerful tools to uncover human brain connectome in healthy and disease populations (Sporns et al., 2005; Bullmore and Sporns, 2009; Rubinov and Sporns, 2009; Fornito et al., 2013; Fornito and Bullmore, 2015; Ohno et al., 2016). Diffusion MRI is the only non-invasive neuroimaging technique that can provide exquisite details of WM fiber bundles in vivo, and have been extensively applied in study AD and MCI (Douaud et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2011; Bosch et al., 2012; Huang et al., 2012; Preti et al., 2012; Amlien et al., 2014). Furthermore, the WM connectomes constructed by using diffusion MRI have shown altered topological properties in AD and MCI (Dai and He, 2014; Daianu et al., 2014, 2015; Gorges et al., 2015; Phillips et al., 2015; Preti et al., 2015; Sun et al., 2014; Zhan et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2015; Palesi et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2016). Intriguingly, Daianu et al. (2013) found significant differences between the left and right hemispheres, in the k-core matrices, between AD, and MCI. Specifically, the entire k-core was “lost” in the left hemisphere of AD subjects, suggesting lateralized deficits in connectome topology of AD.\" This suggests a relationship between WM and MCI, but not specifically in PD patients.\n\nThe introduction section also mentions that \"To test this hypothesis, diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was utilized to construct hemispheric brain WM networks for AD patients, MCI patients, and normal control (NC) subjects.\" This paragraph mentions the groups being studied.\n\nHowever, I cannot find a direct answer to the relationship between WMH and MCI in PD patients in the provided images.\n</think>\n<answer> No answer.\n</answer>",

It also notes that exosomes from different cell types can have different functions. (bbox_2d: (443, 509, 652, 903), Image_index: 1).\n3.  Scan Image 2.

Synthesize information: Based on the text in Image 1, exosomes have various biological functions, including involvement in physiological and pathological processes, intercellular communication, and antigen presentation.\n</think>\n<answer> Exosomes are involved in many physiological processes, both beneficial and pathological. Initially, exosomes were characterized as a means for the maturing reticulocytes to get rid of superfluous proteins. Studies have now shown that exosomes are involved in elimination of unnecessary proteins or unwanted molecules from the cell, exchange of materials between cells, intercellular communication, propagation of pathogenic functions of the immune system (both stimulatory and inhibitory), antigen presentation, and many more.

I will read this section more carefully. The text states, \"Xu et al. [41] show that junctional adhesion molecule-A (JAM-A) was highly expressed in DLBCL patients with multiple extranodal lesions\". This is not directly related to the question. I will continue scanning. I find the following sentence: \"ICT1 was upregulated in fresh DLBCL samples compared with the corresponding normal tissues using quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting. ICT1 overexpression was associated with poor overall survival. Finally, they found in DLBCL cell lines that shRNA-mediated knockdown of ICT1 suppressed proliferation, induced cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase, and apoptosis. Further verification showed that inhibition of ICT1 gene expression caused the upregulation of the p21, Bad and caspase-3, and downregulation of PCNA, Cyclin, CDK4, CDK6, and Cyclin D1.\" This also does not answer the question. I will continue searching. I found the following paragraph: \"Xu et al. [41] investigated the role of ICT1, immature colon carcinoma transcript-1, a crucial member of the large mitoribosomal subunit in mitochondrial ribosome, which has been shown to be closely related to tumorigenesis. This study started with an analysis of the public available Oncomine database in which they found that the expression levels of ICT1 mRNA was significantly upregulated in DLBCL tissues. Next, they confirmed that ICT1 was upregulated in fresh DLBCL samples compared with the corresponding normal tissues using quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting.\" This paragraph does not answer the question.\n\nAfter reviewing all the images, I can't find the information about the number of cryopreserved primary MCL samples identified from the Barts Cancer Institute tissue bank.\n</think>\n<answer> No answer.\n</answer>",
