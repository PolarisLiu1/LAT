I find a section discussing the impact of the pandemic on developing economies, including digital technology adoption and internet usage. It also mentions the acceleration of digital technology.\n2.  In Image 1, I find the paragraph \"The pandemic is accelerating the adoption of digital technology. Companies are moving online, and people are working remotely. Digital technology is unlikely to generate double-digit growth. However, it is likely to boost productivity and efficiency. Together with no other choice, the new normal of remote working could sustainably transform domestic emerging economies.\" which mentions remote work.\n3.  Searching further in Image 1, I find another relevant paragraph: \"New internet companies are rising quickly outside China as well. Many of them are in e-commerce, fintech, and education. These companies are expanding their reach to smaller towns and rural areas. They are also creating new jobs and opportunities for office operations, making it easy for start-ups to get going. On average, internet companies are growing faster and creating more jobs in countries with emerging economies than in countries with developed ones.\" which relates to changes in company structure and job creation.\n4.  In Image 3, I find a section discussing work patterns. \"More people than ever before are working from home. People will work from home far more often than they used to. The office will be used less, and this is not to say the office is dead (see our blog: https://bit.ly/3b96u8z), but it will be used differently.\" This indicates a shift towards more remote work and less office use.\n5.  Image 3 also states: \"The issue of work-life balance will be a hot topic. People working from home have to manage their work and their work are greater users of public transport (which is generally accepted to emit less CO2 per passenger than private cars) will be reluctant to return to using public transport and will use their cars more. This will lead to issues about freedom of choice, flexibility and empowerment, all key qualitative factors in the scales of sustainable development.\" This suggests potential changes in commuting.\n6.  Image 3 also mentions: \"There will be more car use, and the car parks will be full. This will be because of the perception that the use of cars will keep cars. Will carry out fewer short journeys (the most pollution emitting, least efficient, type of journey).\" This indicates a potential increase in car usage due to concerns about public transport.\n\nBased on these findings, the working patterns will change after the Covid crisis in the following ways:\n\n*   Increased remote work.\n*   Less frequent office use, with offices being used differently.\n*   More reliance on digital technologies.\n*   Potential increase in car usage due to concerns about public transport.\n*   Greater focus on work-life balance.\n*   Changes in commuting patterns.\n</think>\n<answer> Working patterns will change after the Covid crisis with increased remote work, less office use, greater reliance on digital technology, a potential increase in car usage, a greater focus on work-life balance, and changes in commuting patterns.

I will read through the listed uses and benefits.\n    *   **Water Treatment:** Effective against pathogens like Cryptosporidium and Giardia. bbox_2d: (212, 15, 234, 649), Image_index: 1\n    *   **Industrial Applications:** Used in the paper and pulp industry for bleaching, improving paper quality and reducing unwanted odors. bbox_2d: (254, 15, 278, 649), Image_index: 1\n    *    **Food and Beverage Industry:** Used as a sanitizer for food contact surfaces, extending shelf life, and sanitizing equipment. bbox_2d: (294, 15, 315, 674), Image_index: 1\n    *   **Medical and Healthcare:** Used in disinfection solutions, controlling the spread of infections. bbox_2d: (352, 15, 374, 666), Image_index: 1\n    *   **Air and HVAC Systems:** Improves indoor air quality by eliminating odors and microorganisms. bbox_2d: (394, 15, 417, 658), Image_index: 1\n    *   **Waste Management:** Reduces odor, breaks down harmful compounds, and disinfects sludge. bbox_2d: (437, 15, 463, 674), Image_index: 1\n\n2.  **Image 2:** This image discusses Photocatalytic Oxidation, not chlorine dioxide. So, it's not relevant to the question.\n\n3.  **Image 3:** This image discusses disinfectant fogging machines, and it mentions chlorine dioxide as one of the possible disinfectants.\n    *   **Chlorine Dioxide:** Leaves behind no harmful residue, but requires very strict temperature parameters. bbox_2d: (939, 136, 958, 369), Image_index: 3\n\nCombining the information from Image 1 and Image 3, I can summarize the benefits.\n</think>\n<answer> Chlorine dioxide offers several benefits across various industries: It's a powerful disinfectant effective against various pathogens in water treatment (bbox_2d: (212, 15, 234, 649), Image_index: 1). It's used for bleaching and odor control in the paper and pulp industry (bbox_2d: (254, 15, 278, 649), Image_index: 1), sanitization in the food and beverage industry (bbox_2d: (294, 15, 315, 674), Image_index: 1), and disinfection in healthcare settings (bbox_2d: (352, 15, 374, 666), Image_index: 1). It improves air quality in HVAC systems (bbox_2d: (394, 15, 417, 658), Image_index: 1) and aids in waste management by reducing odor and breaking down harmful compounds (bbox_2d: (437, 15, 463, 674), Image_index: 1). When used in fogging, it leaves no harmful residue (bbox_2d: (939, 136, 958, 369), Image_index: 3).\n</answer>",
