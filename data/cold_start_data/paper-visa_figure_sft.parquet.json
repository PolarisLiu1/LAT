I need to find a figure that shows the relationship between nicotine and the release of these two substances. Figure 4 in Image 2 seems relevant. Let's analyze it in detail.\n\n1.  **Locate Figure 4:** Figure 4 is found on Image 2. \nBounding box: {\"bbox_2d\": [109, 47, 519, 718], \"Image_index\": 2}\n2.  **Analyze the caption:** The caption states \"Chemically and electrically induced [³H]-ACh and [³H]-NA release from rat IPN. (A) [³H]-ACh release in response to a 30 s pulse of 30 µM nicotine (indicated by the horizontal bar at the 4 min time point).\" This indicates that the figure indeed shows the effect of nicotine on the release of [³H]-ACh and [³H]-NA. \nBounding box: {\"bbox_2d\": [150, 573, 519, 625], \"Image_index\": 2}\n3.  **Examine sub-figures:**\n    *   Sub-figure A shows the time course of [³H]-ACh release with a nicotine pulse. \nBounding box: {\"bbox_2d\": [175, 47, 434, 184], \"Image_index\": 2}\n    *   Sub-figures B1 and B2 show the area under the curve (AUC) for [³H]-ACh release under different conditions, including nicotine. \nBounding box: {\"bbox_2d\": [175, 195, 272, 348], \"Image_index\": 2}\n    *   Sub-figure C1 and C2 shows AUC of [3H]-ACh release under different conditions, including nicotine and P.TTX. \nBounding box: {\"bbox_2d\": [285, 195, 391, 348], \"Image_index\": 2}\n    *   Sub-figure D shows the dose-response curve for nicotine-induced [³H]-ACh release. {\"bbox_2d\": [399, 195, 502, 348], \"Image_index\": 2}\n    *    Sub-figure E1 and E2 shows AUC of [3H]-Noradrenaline release under different conditions. \nBounding box: {\"bbox_2d\": [175, 368, 352, 571], \"Image_index\": 2}\n    *    Sub-figure F shows the dose-response curve for nicotine-induced [3H]-Noradrenaline release. \nBounding box: {\"bbox_2d\": [399, 368, 502, 571], \"Image_index\": 2}\n\n4.  **Synthesize information:** Figure 4 shows that nicotine induces the release of both [³H]-ACh and [³H]-NA. The dose-response curves (D and F) show that increasing concentrations of nicotine lead to increased release of both substances.
